title: "Who am I"
---

   I am **Alfred Ain Sallwa**, a PhD candidate at **Mzumbe University** (Business School) and a visiting student at Cardiff University Business Education. My research sits at the intersection of supply chain integration and youth healthcare service. I investigate the determinants for supply chain integration and its possible effect on improving the availability of adolescents and youth sexual reproductive health commodities. 

I work closely with supervisors and collaborators across academia and practice, and I enjoy building reproducible causal pipelines (R/Quarto/Git), delivering hands‑on training, and translating technical research into operational guidance for supply chain practitioners. <add your story here: see an example:

## Research focus / PhD project
  
  While more efforts and interventions are directed at improving the health of young men and women in Africa, this study posits that supply chain integration (SCI) is the backbone of the healthcare facilities in ensuring the availability of AYSRH commodities.

My research aims to assess the determinants of supply chain integration, and its effect on ensuring the availability of adolescent and youth sexual reproductive health (AYSRH) commodities in Tanzania.

The study focuses on the downstream level of the AYSRH service delivery by surveying the public healthcare centers in the Shinyanga, Geita, Simiyu, and Katavi regions and analyzing healthcare workers’ perceptions using R analysis to run the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM).

The study will provide evidence and informed decisions on the effective implementation of the SCI towards enhancing AYSRH service provision.

- Practically, the study will provide new insights to healthcare supply chain actors involved in moving AYSRH commodities.

- Theoretically, the study challenges institutional theory by integrating it with the resource-based view to offer a holistic evaluation of the healthcare supply chain.
