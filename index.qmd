  I am a Lecturer, Research Associate, and Consultant in Logistics and Supply Chain Management with a passion for advancing sustainable and resilient supply chains in Africa. Since beginning my academic journey in 2017, I have been dedicated to teaching, research, and capacity building in the field of business and logistics.
  
In 2020, I joined the College of Business Education (CBE); a leading public institution in business education based in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; where I continue to contribute to academic excellence and applied research.

Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in Health Supply Chain Management at Mzumbe University Business School and serve as a Visiting Student at Cardiff University Business School (UK), affiliated with the Data Lab for Social Good research group.

My doctoral research explores how Supply Chain Integration (SCI) can enhance the availability of Adolescent and Youth Sexual and Reproductive Health (AYSRH) commodities in Tanzania. The study underscores the idea that effective supply chain integration forms the backbone of healthcare facilities in ensuring reliable access to essential health commodities for young people across Africa.
